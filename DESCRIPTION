Description: Convenient functions and templates to create nicer looking output.
    The RMarkdown template provided by this package makes it easier to start
    a new analysis rather than starting from a blank RMarkdown document. There 
    are also convenient functions to quickly create output for common or overly
    complex tables and plots.
